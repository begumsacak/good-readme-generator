# Readme.md Generator

## Description

Having a good readme.md file is important for any coding project to inform others about how the project works. I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Getting Started

This is a command-line application, so any user who want to generate a readme file will need to run `node index (name if the file)` to access the prompts installed by the inquirer package.

Then, the user should answer a set of a questions to create a readme file for their projects.

Finally, a readme file is generated with the following information:
* Title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions (for questions, user's preferred contact methods will be generated)
